# paddorch

## Introduction
PaddlePaddle is the DL framework developped by Baidu, and this library is aim to provide 
a PaddlePaddle wrapper for the common pytorch interface, so people can try out paddlepaddle on their
pytorch code without much change.


## install
`pip install .`


## Examples

Paddorch is used to reimplement below projects
